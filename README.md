- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ragnarwof94
- 👀 I'm interested in exploring new technologies and diving into the world of full-stack development with JavaScript and Python.
- 🌱 Currently, I'm learning full-stack JavaScript and Python to build dynamic and robust web applications.
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on open-source projects and connect with fellow developers passionate about full-stack development.
- 📫 How to reach me. You can reach me through https://www.linkedin.com/in/rodolfo-guerrero-cisterna-8841b8186
- 😄 Pronouns: Rodo, Dani, Ragnar 👀
- ⚡ Fun fact:  I'm passionate about music and a self-taught musician, playing both the guitar and bass. While delving into full-stack development with JavaScript and Python, I always find time to explore nature and marvel at its wonders. When I'm not in front of the computer, you can catch me crafting melodies or immersing myself in the mysteries of the cosmos, as I have a keen interest in astronomy. I'm open to collaborations on intriguing projects, so feel free to reach out. 🎶🌌
